Your response goes here!

1. I’ve learned new HTML tags, such as <hr> and <del> from the mockup project.
2. Yes! It’s been pretty easy for me because I took the old version of the HTML lessons two months ago. :) But it’s always great to refresh old knowledge. 
3. Nothing has been difficult so far. 
4. I have used the super helpful *Googling* strategy to help me search for the <hr> and <del> tags to finish the mockup project.
